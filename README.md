### What I learned


From this project, I gained proficiency in two key areas: utilizing flexbox for efficient positioning of elements and implementing media queries to ensure mobile responsiveness. These skills have significantly enhanced my ability to create versatile and user-friendly layouts that adapt seamlessly across various screen sizes and devices.

```css
body  {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
    background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    font-family: "outfit", sans-serif;
    font-style: normal;
    font-size: 16px;
    margin: 10% 10%;
    align-content: center;
  }
```
### Continued development

I am committed to further honing my CSS and media query skills. These areas of expertise are crucial for creating visually appealing and responsive web designs. By dedicating time and effort to improving these skills, I aim to enhance my ability to craft engaging user experiences that seamlessly adapt to different devices and screen sizes.
